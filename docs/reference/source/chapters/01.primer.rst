    :class: note

    For a more in-depth and possibly up-to-date description of the
    capabilities of reStructuredText and Sphinx, refer to the 
    `Sphinx reStructuredText primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#restructuredtext-primer>`_.

    Other references:

    - `reStructuredText reference: figures <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#images>`_
    - `reStructuredText reference: directives <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html>`_

**reStructuredText** allows you flexibility close to that of
LaTeX with terser syntax. Both LaTeX and HTML are rendered 
from it, abstracting content from typesetting. Sphinx reStructuredText 
supports LaTeX math, citations, cross-refernces, lists, figures, tables, 
text highlight markup, file inclusion and more.

.. admonition:: Benefits
    :class: important

    - Write a **singular**, **pleasant to read** documentation source for your project.
    - Customize LaTeX and HTML output with **content agnostic** LaTeX style files and HTML+CSS templates (starting with Sphinx's) **usable across all your projects**.
    
    And lastly,

    - Document your project directly from the **docstrings** of your code.

What follows is a demonstration of the fundamental capabilities
of Sphinx reStructuredText for technical writing, as well as
best practices for writing and generating documentation with Sphinx.

Much of the same will be demonstrated again in :ref:`Your Project`,
with a twist: :ref:`Your Project` is generated directly from the
source code in this proejct.

.. admonition:: MIND THE BACKTICKS
    :class: danger

    reStructuredText makes use of **backticks** (U+0060 *GRAVE ACCENT*)
    for its commands. 
    
    **Not to be confused for apostrophes (** ``'`` **)!**
