Block equations. Unlabeled, and thus unnumbered,

    e^{\pi i} = -1

By default Sphinx will place your LaTeX equations inside
of an ``equation`` LaTeX environment.
You can overrride this with the ``:nowrap:`` attribute of the 
``.. math::`` directive. As HTML math consists of your LaTeX
equations rendered and exported in SVG format, ``:nowrap:`` 
equations will display normally in HTML.

The equation below lies within a user-specified LaTeX environment.

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
        \max_{\rho,\lambda} \quad & \rho \\
                                    & (x^Tx)^d(V(x) - \rho) + \lambda(x)\dot{V}(x) \quad is \quad SOS
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}

.. admonition:: BEWARE
    :class: danger

    **User-specified equation environments will break equation
    labeling in LaTeX**. In particular, it seems that Sphinx will internally 
    replace the reference to the new equation by a reference to the previous 
    equation. This happens both for numbered and unnumbered LaTeX equation
    environments.

    If you are considering user-specified equation environments, make
    absolutely sure you cannot obtain what you desire within the ``equation``
    environment.

    If you wish to do so anyway, and **wish to label your equations** for 
    cross-referencing in your **site documentation** at the expense of that
    in LaTeX form, make sure to **use an unnumbered equation environment** such 
    as ``equation*``:

    .. code-block:: reStructuredText

        .. math::
            :label: equation2
            :nowrap:

            \begin{equation*}
                \begin{aligned}
                \max_{\rho,\lambda} \quad & \rho \\
                                            & (x^Tx)^d(V(x) - \rho) + \lambda(x)\dot{V}(x) \quad is \quad SOS
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation*}

    Otherwise, the HTML rendering of your equations will display two numberings:
    that assigned to it by the LaTeX renderer used to generate the site's SVG equations, 
    and that later assigned to it by Sphinx.
