Extensions
==========

It is possible to extend Sphinx reStructuredText to
suit unsatisfied needs.

This can be done by creating new

- ``classes``,
- ``:roles:``, and
- ``.. directives::``

It is easiest to extend Sphinx's HTML rendering 
capabilities by creating new CSS classes.

.. admonition:: BEWARE
    :class: danger

    Extensions using CSS classes will have no
    effect on LaTeX output. New roles or directives
    are necessary to such an effect.

Creating new roles and directives is more involved.
For creating new roles, refer to the `blog post by 
Doug Hellmann <https://doughellmann.com/posts/defining-custom-roles-in-sphinx/>`_.
For creating new directives, heed Sphinx forums
and the online guidance you may find.

The following are the extensions present in this
Sphinx configuration.

Classes
-------

Center

Center HTML elements. Works with text as well 
as side-by-side ``images``, section headings, 
and perhaps any other HTML element.

.. code-block:: reStructuredText

    .. rst-class:: center

        Centered elements.
