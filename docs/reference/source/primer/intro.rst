The following is a demonstration of what you can achieve by
using Sphinx and reStructuredText to document your projects.

The capabilities of reStructuredText and Sphinx will be
discussed and demonstrated, as well as best practices for 
writing and generating documentation with Sphinx.

Sphinx allows you to document your project with the docstrings 
in your code. You will find here what you must know to produce
technical documents from your code. Lastly, you will see the
documentation generated from the example source code in this
repository.
