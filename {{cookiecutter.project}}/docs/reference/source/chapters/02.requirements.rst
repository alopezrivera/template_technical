Requirements
============

.. important::

    Sphinx needs to complete two tasks to generate a documentation
    site and report for your project:

    - Sphinx needs to successfully **scan your source code** for documentation in the form of docstrings, and
    - Sphinx needs to successfully **render your documentation**.

Care for the structure of your source code and the syntax of 
your documentation sources is fundamental.

Source code structure
---------------------

Say that you want to create documentation from the docstrings
in your code. **Two conditions**:

- Your project must be a Python **package**
- Your **package** must have a ``__version__`` global variable

.. admonition:: Global variables
    :class: note

    You can declare the ``__version__`` in the ``__init__.py`` of
    your project's Python package.

    If your project consists of a single script, you can declare
    it anywhere in your script.


Writing docstrings successfully
-------------------------------

- Use raw strings.
- Write reStructuredText (:ref:`Primer`).
